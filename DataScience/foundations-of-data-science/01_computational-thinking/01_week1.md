## Why Data Science? What is it?

Data Science is about taking large data sets and trying to make them useful and meaningful. This involves a combination of computing, statistics, and domain knowledge in the area of your data set. What this results in is a science that is used to draw useful conclusions from data using computation. 

The practice of data science has three core activities:
 1. Exploration - figuring out what patterns exist in the data through analysis or visualizations
 2. Inference - some patterns are there by chance and others are deeply meaningful. Inference is the process of differentiating between the two
 3. Prediction - when we have partial information about what we want to know, prediction is making educated guesses about what will occur. Or, training a machine to make predictions for us.

This course will explore all three of these activities in order.
