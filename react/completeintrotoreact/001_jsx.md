# JSX

As we said in the last section, component-based architecture wouldn't be very fun to use if we couldn't compose our application by just using the component names. This is where JSX comes in. JSX is html inside of JavaScript. It sounds crazy, but it is actually going to be our best friend for component-based applications. Here is an example of JSX in action:

```text
var MyTitle = function(props) {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1 style={{ color: props.color }}>{props.title}</h1>
        </div>
    );
};


var MyFirstComponent = function(props) {
  return (
    <div id="my-first-component">
      <MyTitle title="Props are great!" color="rebeccapurple" />
      <MyTitle title="Use props everywhere!" color="mediumaquamarine" />
      <MyTitle title="Props are the best!" color="peru" />
    </div>
  );
};

ReactDOM.render(<MyFirstComponent />, document.getElementById("app"));
```

As you can see, JSX is an XML-like syntax for defining the template of a component. It is nice that we are able to use the name of the component in the markup and then pass it in the props as attributes.
