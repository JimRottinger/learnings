# TypeScript Interview-Style Questions

I like including this section in addition to the exercises because I believe you don't truly know something until you are able to explain and/or teach it to another person. I also believe that in order to completely understand a solution to a problem, you have to understand why the problem exists in the first place. For that reason, these will all be open-ended questions, aimed at breaking down the core problems TypeScript solves, and meant to facilitate discussion isntead of being trivia-like.

## Questions

1. Explain the typing system in vanilla JavaScript. What are its strengths and weaknesses?
2. Discuss the advantages of typed programming languages.
3. Explain the difference between a nominal type-checking system and a structural type-checking system.
4. Explain the difference between implicit and explicit type declaration in TypeScript.
5. What are some of the ways to perform explicit type declaration in TypeScript?
6. Give an example (or a few) of when and how interfaces can be used in TypeScript
