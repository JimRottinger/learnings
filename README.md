# Learnings

This repository contains a collection of the notes I take as I learn various technologies.

## AngularJS

These notes pertain to Angular 1.x and not the newer Angular. To learn AngularJS, I worked through the Build Your Own Angular book by Tero Parviainen

- Build Your Own Angular
  - Part 1: Scopes
    - [Chapter 1: Scopes and Dirty-Checking](AngularJS/BuildYourOwnAngular/chapter-one.md)
    - [Chapter 2: Scope Methods](AngularJS/BuildYourOwnAngular/chapter-one.md)

## TypeScript

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript to enabled typed programming. To learn it, I read a lot of official documentation and also watched much of the TypeScript Fundamentals workshop by Mike North on Frontend Masters.
