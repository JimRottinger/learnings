# Learnings

This repository contains a collection of the notes I take as I learn various technologies.

**What I am currently working on:**

* Build Your Own Angular by Tero Parviainen
* Complete Intro to React v3 by Brian Holt

## AngularJS

These notes pertain to Angular 1.x and not the newer Angular. To learn AngularJS, I worked through the Build Your Own Angular book by Tero Parviainen. You can find the code for that [here](https://github.com/JimRottinger/build-your-own-angular).

* Build Your Own Angular
  * Part 1: Scopes
    * [Chapter 1: Scopes and Dirty-Checking](angularjs/buildyourownangular/001_scope-and-dirty-checking.md)
    * [Chapter 2: Scope Methods](angularjs/buildyourownangular/002_scope-methods.md)
    * [Chapter 3: Scope Inheritance](angularjs/buildyourownangular/003_scope-inheritance.md)
    * [Chapter 4: Watching Collections](angularjs/buildyourownangular/004_watching-collections.md)

## React

I am interested in learning React because it has popularized the lightweight, component-based JavaScript framework for composing view layers of applications. Primarily, I would like to learn React in order to develop mobile applications as fun side-projects using React Native.

To learn, I am currently following along with a 14 hour workshop on [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/) called Complete Intro to React v3 by [Brian Holt](https://github.com/btholt)

* Complete Intro to React v3 by Brian Holt
  * [Part 1 - Intro](react/completeintrotoreact/000_intro.md)
  * [Part 2 - JSX](react/completeintrotoreact/001_jsx.md)

## TypeScript

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript to enabled typed programming. To learn it, I read a lot of official documentation and also watched much of the TypeScript Fundamentals workshop by Mike North on Frontend Masters.
